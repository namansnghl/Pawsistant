                <h2>What is a RAG chatbot?</h2>
                <p>RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation to create AI chatbots that can answer questions based on specific documents or websites.</p>

                <h2>How does the chatbot know about your website content?</h2>
                <p>Our chatbot uses web scraping to gather content from our website pages. This content is processed and indexed, allowing the chatbot to retrieve relevant information when answering your questions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Is my conversation with the chatbot private?</h2>
                <p>Yes, conversations with our chatbot are private and not stored beyond the current session. We value your privacy and do not use your questions for training purposes.</p>

                <h2>Can the chatbot answer questions about anything?</h2>
                <p>No, our chatbot is designed to answer questions specifically about the information contained on our website. It doesn't have knowledge about topics outside this scope.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>What if the chatbot gives incorrect information?</h2>
                <p>While we strive for accuracy, AI systems aren't perfect. If you receive information that seems incorrect, please verify it through our official documentation or contact us directly.</p>
